Thank you for your work typesetting our paper. We have some corrections below.
We request to see a new version of the proofs with our suggested changes
incorporated.

AQ1: OK.

AQ2: The city name for Tanguy Bozec should be Gif-sur-Yvette, not Paris. This
applies both for the metadata and for the first page of the paper.

On p. 4, example 6, the line starting with <5> is split after the arrow,
instead of being split after the full stop. See the authors' PDF for how it
should be done.

On p. 16, the heading "E as a Zipperposiiton backend" should not have a period.
In addition, there should be a vertical space preceding it, and the line
following "E as a Zipperpositiion backend" should not be indented. (To see what
the heading should look like, scroll down to "Monomorphisation as a
Preprocessor", which is typeset properly.)

On p. 18, reference 1, "vampire" should be "Vampire".

On p. 18, reference 6, "judgement day" should be "Judgement Day".

On p. 18, reference 9, "light" should be "Light".

On p. 18, reference 10, "Qua Non" should be "qua non".

On p. 19, reference 15: "E - a" should be "E -- a", where -- denotes an en-dash.

Moreover, there are several issues with the tables:

On p. 10:
   - There should be smaller vertical spaces both before and after the table.
   - The symbols \sigma_1, \sigma_2 and \sigma_3 should be centered.
   - The horizontal bar below \sigma_1-3 should be split in three parts matching the columns.
   - The symbols below the \sigma_1-3 should be centered.

On p. 13, Table 1:
   - "mult" should occur at the bottom of the column.
   - All column titles (from "cap" all the way down to "0, 50, 100, 200") should be centered.
   - There should be a small horizontal space between the three groups of of "0, 50, 100, 200".
   - If the spacing between all columns is slightly increased, it should be possible to remove the vertical lines of the tables.

The remaining tables suffer from the same issues:
   - The column titles should be centered
   - The column content should be centered
   - There should be increased spacing between columns
   - Vertical lines should be removed
   - For tables 1 and 2, groups of four columns should be spaced further appart from each other
