TODO:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item contact Sascha Boehme about authorship
        \item are there any implementation of this (or comparable) algorithm in that have been evaluated?
        \item finish implementation
        \item test and evaluate implementation
        \item (can wait) merge implementation (review code with active contributor beforehand)
        \item find pretty inline setup for pseudo code
        \item (in order) write high/low level algo
        \item write implementation and evaluation
        \item write background
        \item write related work
        \item write conclusion
        \item write intro
        \item reread, spellcheck ...

\section{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item context and motivation (automatic theorem proving, better performance)
    \item what we are trying to do (monomorphisation)
    \item basic idea of the algorithm 
    \item overview of the paper
\end{itemize}

\section{Background}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Language, TF1 (might be TH1 or something else)
\end{itemize}

% target page number: 2-4
\section{High level algorithm}

Mathematical description of the algorithm. Set notation and implicit loops.

% target page number: 2-4
\section{Low level algorithm}

Precise algo description (pseudo code). Explicit loops, and bounds.

% target page number: 2-4
\section{Implementation and evaluation}

Introduce context of zipperposition (do it in intro or background?).

Explain how the final bounds were chosen (i liked the way those numbers looked)

Present evaluation method (which problems were used, options used, server characteristics ect...)

Compare the following:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item no call to e (no monomorphisation)
        \item call e on start no monomorphisation
        \item call e (default) no monomorphisation
        \item call e on start monomorphisation
        \item call e (default) monomorphisation
        \item maybe compare a few different bounding heuristics?
    \end{itemize}

Compare performance with implementation of a similar algorithm (if any).

Maybe compare with implementation of other kinds of monomorphisation algorithms (if appropriate).
